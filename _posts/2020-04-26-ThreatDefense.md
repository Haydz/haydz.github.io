title: "Threat Defense Workshop"
---

On April 25th I was fortunate enough to participate in the Trend Micro Threat Defense workshop. 

# What is a Threat Defense Workshop?

## How long was the event?
It was on a Saturday from 9pm to 3:30pm.
6 and a half hours

# What was Involved

## Systems
The network was accessed via the cloud.  
  
Systems within the game:
* A Jump host to rdp into others
* Docker Host
* IIS Webserver
* Database Server (MySQL)

## Tools
This was a Trend Micro event, meaning it was all designed and created by their team. As such the only tool given was Deep Security <LINK HERE>

However there were other tools that were required:
* John The Ripper
* OpenSSL
* Windows Event logs itself
* Command line - for both Linux and Windows

## Challenges
Varied from basic to hard.

Basic examples:  
* what account is being brute forced
* What is the name of <xyz> malware on <xyz host>

To more thinking outside the box:  
* Need to find a password to open a file or gain access to something. Would you brute-force, or look on a server for the password?
* Enabling features within Deep Security tool to give more visibility, or fine tuning


# What Did The Scoreboard Look Like?
This was a unique take on scoreboards.  
  
Instead of just having a ladder and challenges. The idea was that you were 'hacking around the world'. Each country had its own challenge. Obviously it started off in Canada!
