I wanted to blog about security Architecture.

I have been reading and watching a lot of material. I have been taking notes, and it seems to just want to sit in my short term memory. There are CTFs for pentesting and incident response, or hands on network analysis challenges. Nothing as easy for security architecture.

Perhaps I can build up my home lab as much as possible. However this is just so much.

So lets start with a high level view of Security Architecture and domains.

I have been going through a Pluralsight course called:
* Architecture and Design for CompTia Security+
[Found here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/comptia-security-plus-architecture-design/table-of-contents)
