# Intro

So Thursday I participated in an online blue team defense simulation event, known as OpenSOC.

What follows is:
* what the event is
* How I found out about the event
* The Event and my Experience
* Things I learned
* how the event was run
* How an IR course I took in December helped



# What is OpenSOC?
According to their website found here: https://opensoc.io/
> OpenSOC is a blue team defense simulation that is as close to "the real thing" as it gets. This isn’t just another CTF. We’ve built this platform to train real-world responders to handle real-world situations. Our environment is a highly portable, fully functional replication of an enterprise environment, complete with all the trimmings - Active Directory, Exchange, distributed networks, various sensors, log aggregation, end-user simulation, and more.
>
> OpenSOC is comprised of over a dozen open source projects, including the below.

The tools they list are what you would think of:  
* Metasploit
* Osquery
* Snort
* pfsense
* Graylog
* Suricata

\+ others

# How I found out about the event?
Twitter... Seriously twitter!

A post came across my feed asking for interested. I responded and apparently so did enough people that we had 700 people during the event.
