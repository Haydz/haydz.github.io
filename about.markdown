## Whoami:
An information security practitioner originally from Australia. I currently reside in Canada.

## This site:
The goal of this site is to serve as a repository for my presentations, publications and sketchpad of learning.
This blog will not ever be 'fully polished' but instead will be an ever work in progress of learning. As such the site will not be visually 'perfect' and may include grammatical errors. The importance is on the sharing of learning.
